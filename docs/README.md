# Virtual Mouse Lab - Synthetic Mouse Research Platform

## Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated in-silico platform for creating synthetic mice, running experiments, and generating research-grade data. It simulates real mouse phenotypes and behaviors using computational models that incorporate genomic, phenotypic, behavioral, and biomarker data.

The system enables researchers to perform virtual experiments on synthetic mice that mimic real mouse phenotypes, allowing for hypothesis testing and drug screening in a cost-effective, ethical, and time-efficient manner.
